# Releasing

This repository uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and an automated GitHub Actions workflow for releases.

## How to Release

### 1. Add a Changeset

When making a change that should be released, add a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This prompts you to select the version bump (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) and write a short release summary. Commit the generated file in `.changeset/` with your pull request.

### 2. Merge the Pull Request

After review, merge the PR to `main`. No GitHub release label is required.

A push to `main` that includes `.changeset/**` changes automatically starts the release workflow. The workflow then:

1. Checks for pending changesets
2. Notifies the client libraries team in Slack for approval
3. Waits for approval from a maintainer via the GitHub `Release` environment
4. The workflow applies Changesets, syncs the version to pubspec/iOS/Android files, publishes to pub.dev, tags the release, and creates a GitHub Release.
5. Notifies Slack when the release completes or fails

### Manual Trigger

You can also manually trigger the release workflow from the Actions tab with `workflow_dispatch`. Manual runs still require pending changesets.

## Version Bumping

Changesets determines the next version from the committed changeset files:

- **patch**: bug fixes, documentation updates, and internal changes
- **minor**: backwards-compatible features
- **major**: breaking changes

## Troubleshooting

### No changesets found

If the release workflow reports that no changesets were found, make sure your PR includes at least one releasable `.changeset/*.md` file.
